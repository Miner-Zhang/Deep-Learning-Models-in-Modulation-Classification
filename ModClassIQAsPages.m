function out = ModClassIQAsPages(in)
%helperModClassIQAsPages Transform complex input to I/Q as pages
%   OUT = helperModClassIQAsPages(IN) transforms input, IN, which is a cell
%   array where the first element is the complex frame and the second
%   element is the label string. The output, OUT, has a frame where I/Q are
%   placed in the third dimension, separately, such that the size of the
%   output frame is [1xSPFx2], where SPF is samples per frame.
